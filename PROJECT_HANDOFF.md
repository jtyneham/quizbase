# Quizbase — Project Handoff

## Status

Quizbase v1 is the frozen functional/reskin baseline for five games: Missing Word, Missing Word Pokémon, Hangman, Hangman Pokémon, and Random Letter. The goal is no longer speculative base refactoring. Future changes should be driven by a concrete defect, gameplay requirement, or friction discovered during an actual reskin.

The validated baseline is **30/30 Node tests + 57/57 Playwright browser tests** across desktop, phone portrait, and tablet portrait.

## Architecture

- `index.html` contains the launcher and five live game hosts. The obsolete integration placeholder has been removed.
- `js/app.js` owns launcher routing, lazy game registration, Home navigation, haptics, and shared fullscreen service wiring.
- `js/core/missing-word-engine.js` is the shared Missing Word controller; `missing-word-logic.js` contains pure selection/masking logic.
- `js/core/hangman-engine.js` is the shared Hangman controller; `hangman-logic.js` contains pure answer/guess logic.
- `js/games/` contains thin variant configuration wrappers rather than duplicated engines.
- Pokémon topic ordering/filtering is centralized in `js/core/pokemon-topics.js`.
- Shared device/fullscreen behavior lives in `js/core/device.js`; shared UI behavior lives in `js/core/ui.js`.
- Game datasets remain under `data/`.

## Reskin contract

`css/theme.css` defines inherited semantic `--qb-*` tokens for reusable visual decisions. Major UI roles expose stable `data-ui` hooks. These are the preferred extension points because four game components use Shadow DOM and global selectors cannot style their internals directly.

The current layout is not sacred. A reskin may radically reconstruct composition and presentation. Preserve gameplay behavior, data semantics, responsive usability, accessibility, interaction feedback, semantic hooks used by tests, and the shared-engine boundary.

See `RESKINNING.md` for the complete visual workflow and regression checklist.

## Important behavior contracts

- Missing Word siblings share one engine but retain separate datasets/topic configuration.
- Hangman siblings share one engine but retain separate datasets/topic configuration and visual entry points.
- Hangman New Word uses a two-click in-button confirmation: `New Word` -> `New Word?` -> reset.
- Hangman Solve mode uses the `solve-ui open` state.
- Hangman answer slots use `.letter-slot`; multiline answers must remain fully visible.
- Random Letter's Ideas checkbox is operated through its visible control/label; the checkbox input itself is intentionally non-pointer-interactive.
- Topic pickers must support Apply/Cancel and outside-dismiss without the opening click immediately closing them.
- Existing animation/transition behavior is product behavior unless a task explicitly changes it.

## Testing

First-time setup:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Normal development gate:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

Useful narrower commands:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:desktop
```

Do not weaken a failing regression merely to make a reskin pass. Determine whether the failure is a real product regression or an obsolete test assumption, then fix the correct side.

## Historical lessons retained

The most expensive bugs in earlier versions came from visual/refactor work silently breaking interaction behavior: Home navigation, Hangman Pokémon New Word, topic-picker lifecycle, responsive Hangman answer visibility, and stale test selectors. Shared engines and browser-level tests now exist specifically to prevent those regressions from being rediscovered manually.

Mobile/tablet behavior must be validated independently rather than inferred from a resized desktop window. Maintain readable contrast and prevent controls, fullscreen actions, answer areas, and keyboards from overlapping at constrained viewports.

## Freeze rule

Treat this v1 state as the known-good master base. For a new visual language, clone/fork this baseline, implement the reskin, then run `npm run test:all`. Further Quizbase-core refactoring should happen only when an actual use case demonstrates that the current extension points are insufficient.

## Regression lesson: real interaction paths (2026-08-27)
- Missing Word generation must be tested as a full human cycle: Next Word -> Reveal -> click word card -> Next Word -> next generation, and the primary action must never remain disabled/generating.
- Missing Word - Pokemon starts in All Topics mode when no explicit initial topics are configured.
- Popup outside-dismiss logic must use the event composed path. Topic chips re-render on click; checking only `owner.contains(event.target)` after the target is detached can falsely classify an inside click as outside and close the picker.
- Hangman E2E coverage must click individual topic chips and verify multi-select while the picker remains open; Select All alone does not cover this interaction.
